/* Inheritance in C++

The capability of a class to derive propertiesand characteristics
from another class is called Inheritance.Inheritance is one of the 
most important features of Object - Oriented Programming. 
Inheritance is a feature or a process in which, new classes are created 
from the existing classes.The new class created is called “derived class” 
or “child class” and the existing class is known as the “base class” or
“parent class”.The derived class now is said to be inherited from the base class.

When we say derived class inherits the base class, it means, the derived class
inherits all the properties of the base class, without changing the properties 
of base classand may add new features to its own.These new features in the 
derived class will not affect the base class.The derived class is the specialized
class for the base class.

Sub Class : The class that inherits properties from another
class is called Subclass or Derived Class.

Super Class : The class whose properties are inherited by a 
subclass is called Base Class or Superclass.
